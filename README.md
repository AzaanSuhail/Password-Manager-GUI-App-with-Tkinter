# Password Manager App

## Introduction

The Password Manager App is a simple utility built using tkinter, designed to help users manage and generate passwords. While it allows you to create and store passwords in plain text, it does not currently support reading previously stored passwords.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: You can use this app to generate strong, random passwords. This feature helps you create secure and unique passwords for your accounts.

- **Password Storage**: The app allows you to input and store passwords for various accounts, making it convenient to keep track of your login credentials.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy for users of all levels to interact with the app.

- **Secure Storage**: The app is designed for local use and does not transmit or store passwords on external servers. It's essential to ensure the security of your local environment.
